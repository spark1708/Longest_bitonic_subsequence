# Longest_bitonic_subsequence
A subsequence of array is called Bitonic if it is first increasing, then decreasing.
ex1=>
Input: nums = [1, 2, 5, 3, 2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The sequence {1, 2, 5} is
increasing and the sequence {3, 2} is 
decreasing so merging both we will get 
length 5.

ex2=>
Input: nums = [1, 11, 2, 10, 4, 5, 2, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The bitonic sequence 
{1, 2, 10, 4, 2, 1} has length 6.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n2)
Expected Space Complexity: O(n)
